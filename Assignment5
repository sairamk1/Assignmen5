#1. Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.


def divide(x, y): 
    try: 
        # Floor Division : Gives only Fractional Part as Answer 
        result = x // y 
        print("Yeah ! Your answer is :", result) 
    except ZeroDivisionError: 
        print("Sorry ! You are dividing by zero ") 
  
# Look at parameters and note the working of Program 
divide(3, 0) 

OUTPUT
Sorry ! You are dividing by zero 

#2.Problem Statement? ?1
#Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in
#["Americans", "Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in
#["Baseball","cricket"]
#Hint: Subject,Verb and Object should be declared in the program as shown below.
#subjects=["Americans ","Indians"]
#verbs=["play","watch"]
#objects=["Baseball","Cricket"]
#Output should come as below:
#Americans play Baseball.
#Americans play Cricket.
#Americans watch Baseball.
#Americans watch Cricket.
#Indians play Baseball.
#Indians play Cricket.
#Indians watch Baseball.
#Indians watch Cricket.


subject=["Americans", "Indians"]
verb=["Play", "watch"]
obj=["Baseball","cricket"]

# Use list comprehension instead of looping over each of the predicates
sentence_list = [(sub+" "+ vb + " " + ob) for sub in subject for vb in verb for ob in obj]
for sentence in sentence_list:
 print (sentence)
 
 OUTPUT
 Americans Play Baseball
Americans Play cricket
Americans watch Baseball
Americans watch cricket
Indians Play Baseball
Indians Play cricket
Indians watch Baseball
Indians watch cricket
